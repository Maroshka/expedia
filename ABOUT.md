The application consumes the API mentioned in the task description, after filling some more parameters by the user in the form 
presented in the index.html page, and renders the search results in deals.html page. 

The concept of consuming an API wasnt new to me, however im new to the Dango framework, but i chose it because im most comfortable with scripting in the Python programming language. 

You can see the app deployed on Heroku through this link https://expedia-assignment303.herokuapp.com/
