The application consumes the API mentioned in the task description, after filling some more parameters by the user in the form 
presented in the index.html page, and renders the search results in deals.html page. 

My framework of choice was Django, a free open-source web framework that follows the model-view-template (MVT) architectural pattern. Im actually preety new to the framework, but i chose it because im most comfortable with scripting in the Python programming language.

I have written two simple unit tests, that test the root url page '/', and the returned htm response when requesting the find_deal view function. You can run the tests using "python3 manage.py test".

You can see the app deployed on Heroku through this link https://expedia-assignment303.herokuapp.com/ 
(P.S. I really suck at documenting stuff)
